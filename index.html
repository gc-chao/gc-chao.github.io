        <h3>2021-2024 | Diving into AI Learning & Development</h3>
        <p>
          During this period, numerous projects began using AI technologies.
          To keep up, I learned about statistical learning theory, traditional machine learning models, and deep neural networks.
          While learning, I wrote study notes and coded classical models like DT, SVM, FNN, CNN, RNN/LSTM, and Transformer from scratch.
          Now, I still work on training, optimizing, and deploying AI models in different projects.

        <h3>2018-2021 | Transition to Architecture Design & Project Management</h3>
        <p>
          As more government systems were developed, my role gradually shifted from front-line programmer to architecture design and project manager.
          I refactored the development framework to adapt to SOA architecture and introduced numerous cloud service middleware components.
          To address diverse requirements, I expanded the framework with script, workflow, and low-code engines, along with support for WebSocket, SIP, ModBus, GIS, and streaming media technologies.
          Additionally, following software engineering principles, I established a comprehensive set of development standards and management systems, and led the team to build an internal collaboration platform.

        <h3>2015-2018 | Embracing Mobile Internet & Passion for Building Wheels</h3> 
        <p>
           Recognizing Java's potential for future internet development, I shifted the web stack to JSP/Servlet.
           From this foundation, I built basic scaffolding that separated request routing, controller logic, and view rendering. 
           Through practical projects, I refined it by adding ORM, MVC, AOP, MQ, and other components, eventually evolving it into an internal backend framework.
           Similarly, what started as a simple AJAX-based SPA rendering engine evolved into an internal frontend framework with MVC, animation, UI, and native-bridge features.
           As I embraced the surging mobile internet, I tackled new architectural challenges, including payment security, concurrency and synchronization, load balancing, caching strategies, and third-party service integration.

        <h3>2010-2014 | Expanding into Embedded Systems and Web Development</h3> 
        <p>
          During these years, I worked on three technical areas at the same time.
          On the .NET platform, I focused on WinForm applications and started developing my own programming framework (including DAL, MVC components).
          This work formed the foundation for my Master's thesis <i>A Model-Driven Approach to the Dynamic Construction of Management Information Systems</i>. 
          Additionally, I began exploring embedded systems, designing hardware to collect data using microcontrollers, and writing programs for devices like medical equipment and card readers.
          I also transitioned web development from Windows to Linux, adopting the LAMP stack and gaining practical server administration experience on CentOS.

        <h3>2006-2010 | From Theory to Practice in University Years</h3>
        <p>
          University provided my formal foundation in computer science, but the real learning happened outside the classroom.
          I co-ran a student tech workshop (PC repair, networking, and programming).
          During these years, I developed many desktop applications—from a competition scoring system and a small expert system to a student attendance MIS.
          I also contributed front-end development for faculty-led web projects.
          My graduation project was <i>2D Role-Playing Game Engine Design and Implementation for Windows Platform</i>.</p>

        <h3>1995-2006 | Beginnings and Early Exploration</h3>
        <p>
          Starting from an 80286 running DOS through the evolution of Windows up to XP, this period built my fundamental understanding of personal computers from the ground up.
          Though the workflows were slow and manual compared to today, they forced me to understand every step of the process. 
          Visual Basic then introduced me to the world of graphical, event-driven programming. 
          But the most exciting moment was publishing my class's first homepage and sharing it with everyone.
